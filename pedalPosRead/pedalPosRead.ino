    NOTES:
    This code is used to read the position of the prototype pedal using the built-in hall effect
    sensors. The pedal has two hall effect sensors for redundancy and so a different read out is given for
    each of the sensors.

    MAIN HALL EFFECT SENSOR PINOUT:
    POWER(GREEN) --> 5V
    GROUND(WHITE) --> GND
    SENSE(GREY) --> A1

    BACKUP HALL EFFECT SENSOR PINOUT:
    POWER(YELLOW) --> 5V
    GROUND(BLUE) --> GND
    SENSE(RED) --> A2
